        <h4>How to Use Tableau</h4>
        <p>Because I have only have the 14 day trial of Tableau and not the 'real' version I was not able to embed a graph onto my website, despite my very best effort... So lesson learned, you can't do the 14 day trial for this class. If there is a problem, see Prof Reese, she knows all about it! So sorry! Here is a picture of a graph instead.</p>
